# In a Nutshell: Qanary Question Answering Components

The [Qanary Framework](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/) is dedicated to create Question Answering systems. Question Answering (QA) is a task requiring different fields leading to expensive / time consuming engineering tasks which might block research as it is too expensive. Typical problems/usecases that might occur while developing a question answering system are:

 * an algorithm is require analyzing textual questions and annotating the found entities, relations, classes, etc. 
    * it is time consuming as there are many services / algorithms / tools which need to compared 
 * your QA process needs to be improved
    * following traditional development approaches requires additional efforts for testing and debugging of code to uncover possible flaws
 * the quality of components dedicated to a particular task need to be analyzed
    * it is expensive to integrate all of the particular components due to a missing generalized interface

In this repository, the [components of the Qanary framework](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components)  are stored. All components are implemented in Java and provide a Docker container for lightweight maintaince.

## Big Picture
 * Qanary is providing the methodology for a knowledge-driven, vocabular-based approach. Our long-term agenda is to create a knowledge-driven ecosystem for the field of Question Answering. It is part of the [WDAqua project](http://wdaqua.eu) where question answering systems are researched and developed.
 * [Qanary Framework](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/) is providing the core framework for creating Question Answering systems following the Qanary methodology. You might consider the Qanary Framework as reference implementation of the Qanary framework as microserivce-based component architecture.
 * [Qanary components](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components) is covering the QA components compatible with the Qanary framework.
 * [Frankenstein](https://github.com/WDAqua/Frankenstein) is a supporting framework to establish a toolset for rapid orchestration and benchmarking of Qanary components. For example, it provides the tools to create from 29 components 380 QA systems.


Regarding questions, ideas or any feedback related to Qanary please do not hesitate to [contact the core developers](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/wiki/Who-do-I-talk-to%3F). However, if you like to see a QA system originally built using the Qanary framework, one of our core developers has build a complete end-to-end QA system which allows to query several RDF data stores: [http://wdaqua.eu/qa](http://wdaqua.eu/qa).
